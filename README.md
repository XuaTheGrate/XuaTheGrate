Hello there! I'm Serena, or most people call me Xua. (I am a she!)

I like to mess around with code a lot, my top languages are Python and Kotlin.
I've studied Python for well over 5 years and like to think I'm fairly fluent in the language.
Kotlin is another one of my hobbies, but is more small time (and not Android, sorry).

I'm doing my best to delve into lower languages such as C++ and Rust, so be patient with me.

If you ever need to contact me, you can find me through any of these:
